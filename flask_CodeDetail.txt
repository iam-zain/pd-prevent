Get the user's gender, age, and feature scores from the form.
Create a dictionary of feature scores, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the scores.
Check to make sure that the user has selected at least three features.
If the user has not selected at least three features, return an error message.
Create a list of input vectors. Each input vector consists of the feature name and the score for that feature.
Join the input vectors together with spaces and create a command to run the ThreeModelPrediction.py script. The command takes the age, the number of features, and the input string as arguments.
Run the ThreeModelPrediction.py script and get the output.
Split the output string on spaces and get the prediction term.
Convert the numeric value to a float.
Check the prediction term and set the gauge color accordingly.
Return the output, the gauge color, and the numeric value to the template.
